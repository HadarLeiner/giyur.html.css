        Success stories:
        <h3>Jossi from Brazil:</h3>
        I am 23 years old, my father is jewish my mother not. I made Aliyah one year ago and started a Giur with the
        Rabbinate of the State, which was a lot of bureaucratic busines and I didn't really find someone serious to
        prepare me to live as a Jew. So I turned to Giur4u ,who prepared me for my Giur and helped me to finally
        become jewish halachically.
        I really enjoyed the interesting lessons and appreciate the deep knowledge in judaism I gained through you.
        Thanks to Giur4u!!
        <br>
        <h3>Stefan (Assaf) from Germany: </h3>
        I am 34 years old ,without any jewish heritage.
        After learning about the origins of Christianity I wanted to connect to our jewish roots and join judaism.
        After being pushed from Rabbi to Rabbi in Germany I found Giur4u via the Internet who
        introduced me to the Beis Din in Bnei Brak and really prepared me for the meeting but not just for the
        meeting rather gave me real vessels for my life as a Jew.
        Thankyou so much !
