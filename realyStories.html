        Success stories:
        <h3>Jossi from Brazil:</h3>
        I am 23 years old, my father is jewish my mother not. <br>I made Aliyah one year ago and started a Giur with the
        Rabbinate of the State,<br> which was a lot of bureaucratic busines and I didn't really find someone serious to
        prepare me to live as a Jew.<br> So I turned to Giur4u ,who prepared me for my Giur and helped me to finally
        become jewish halachically.<br>
        I really enjoyed the interesting lessons and appreciate<br> the deep knowledge in judaism I gained through
        you.<br>
        Thanks to Giur4u!!
        <br>
        <h3>Stefan (Assaf) from Germany: </h3>
        I am 34 years old ,without any jewish heritage.<br>
        After learning about the origins of Christianity<br> I wanted to connect to our jewish roots and join
        judaism.<br>
        After being pushed from Rabbi to Rabbi in Germany<br> I found Giur4u via the Internet who<br>
        introduced me to the Beis Din in Bnei Brak<br> and really prepared me for the meeting but not just for the<br>
        meeting rather gave me real vessels for my life as a Jew.<br>
        Thankyou so much !
